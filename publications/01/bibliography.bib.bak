  abstract = {Ultrasound is a main noninvasive modality for the assessment of the
	heart function. Wall tracking from ultrasound data is, however, inherently
	difficult due to weak echoes, clutter, poor signal-to-noise ratio,
	and signal dropouts. To cope with these artifacts, pretrained shape
	models can be applied to constrain the tracking. However, existing
	methods for incorporating subspace shape constraints in myocardial
	border tracking use only partial information from the model distribution,
	and do not exploit spatially varying uncertainties from feature tracking.
	In this paper, we propose a complete fusion formulation in the information
	space for robust shape tracking, optimally resolving uncertainties
	from the system dynamics, heteroscedastic measurement noise, and
	subspace shape model. We also exploit information from the ground
	truth initialization where this is available. The new framework is
	applied for tracking of myocardial borders in very noisy echocardiography
	sequences. Numerous myocardium tracking experiments validate the
	theory and show the potential of very accurate wall motion measurements.
	The proposed framework outperforms the traditional shape-space-constrained
	tracking algorithm by a significant margin. Due to the optimal fusion
	of different sources of uncertainties, robust performance is observed
	even for the most challenging cases.},
